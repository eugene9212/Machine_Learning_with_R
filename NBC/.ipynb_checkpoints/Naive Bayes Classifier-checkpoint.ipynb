    "Naive Bayes Classifier is a classification method using Bayes theorem. The algorithm is quite simple. As it uses Bayes theorem, it decides the class of the sample by comparing the posterior probability. This classifier is probabilistic model, since it assumes the probability distribution of the data and uses iid(identical and independently distributed) assumption for constructing likelihood : If covariates are continuous, we assume Normal distribution and if discrete, Bernoulli or mulinomial distribution."
